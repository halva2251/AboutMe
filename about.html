      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Yevhenii Sauliak, also known as Yen or halva online. Right now I'm studying Computer Science in Baden Switzerland, focusing on Software Development. I enjoy coding and learning new things, like new technologies, philosophy and exploring new genres of music. My favourite activity is turning the music really loud and locking in while working.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to ride my mountain bike, play video games, going to concerts, and travel with my friends.</p>
        <p>I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, so feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat!</p>
        <p>I don't know what else to write. But because we need 8 sentences per page, I have to yap. This is me yapping about my interests. Do you like it? Me too.</p>
        <p>Best regards, Yen.</p>
